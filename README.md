OpenCV-Xcode-Template
=====================

A Xcode template for a CLI project using OpenCV on OS X

The prefered method for installing OpenCV is (homebrew)[http://brew.sh]
Simply `brew install opencv`. You might need to `brew tap homebrew/science` beforehand.

Simply copy the `.xctemplate` into (create any non-existent sub folder)

- `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Application/Project Templates/OpenCV/` for Xcode 5
- `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/Project Templates/OpenCV/` for Xcode 4
